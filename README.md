## **Hello, everyone!**

I’m **Gabriela Araujo**, I hold a degree in Economics and work at Electra Energy as a BackOffice Analyst. I’m always looking for new opportunities to learn and enhance my skills. 
I have a particular interest in projects involving **Python** and process automation, especially in contexts that require creative solutions to complex challenges.

### **About me:**
🌱 I’m currently learning Statistics and exploring its applications in data analysis.  
👀 I’m interested in Data Analysis, where I seek to better understand the patterns and insights that data can offer.  
⚡ Fun fact: I’m an avid reader and always on the lookout for new book recommendations.  
🔍 Interested in seeing more of my work? Although I don’t have a portfolio yet, I’m planning to create one soon!
